    "# Inference acceleration of `T5` for large batch size / long sequence length / > large models\n",
    "\n",
    "Every week or so, a new impressive few shots learning work taking advantage of auto regressive models are released by some team around the world.\n",
    "Still inference is rarely discussed and few projects are focusing on this aspect.\n",
    "In this notebook, we describe our take to significantly improve autoregressive model latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to use large auto regressive models in production, so we want something:\n",
    "\n",
    "* which scales: the improvement exists on small and large models, for short and long sequences, in greedy and beam search;\n",
    "    * This is very important in a few shots learning where sequences are most of the time hundreds or thousands tokens long and beam search is used to improve text quality.\n",
    "* that has no hidden cost: no big increase in memory usage, no degradation in quality of generated text, support state-of-the-art decoding algorithms;\n",
    "* that is generic: works for any transformer based architecture, and not specific to an inference engine;\n",
    "* that is easy to maintain: no hard-coded behaviors or other technical debt if it doesn't bring a clear advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, we are not targeting the best performance ever but the right trade off (for us at least) between simplicity to use/maintain and acceptable latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "In most situations, performing inference with `Onnx Runtime` or `TensorRT` usually bring large improvement over `Pytorch` implementations.\n",
    "It's very true with `transformer` based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason is that these tools will perform kernel fusions (merging several operations into a single one) and therefore reduce the number of memory bounded operations. Sometimes they also replace some operations by a much faster approximation.\n",
    "In the very specific case of autoregressive languages, things are a bit more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "On most `Pytorch` implementations of these models, there is a `cache` of `K` and `V` values.\n",
    "Let's remind us that in attention blocks, each token is projected on 3 matrices called `Query`, `Key`, and `Value`.\n",
    "Then, those projections will be used to compute a representation of each token which takes into account all the other tokens of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "As autoregressive models generate the sequence one token at a time, they should recompute final representation of all past tokens for each new token to generate.\n",
    "Because each token can only attend to the past, the result of these computations never changes; therefore one simple trick to reduce latency is to just memorize them and reuse them later, avoiding lots of computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the box, the cache mechanism can't be exported to `Onnx` from `Hugging Face` models (and all other `Pytorch` implementations we are aware of).\n",
    "The reason is that those models are not `torchscript` scripting compliant (it requires `Pytorch` code to follow some [restrictive rules](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_builtin_functions.html)).\n",
    "Because of that, `Onnx` export is done through `tracing` which erases any control flow instructions (including the `If` instruction to enable or not a cache).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Existing solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Some interesting solutions targeting inference latency that we have considered and/or tested:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-t5-and-gpt-2-for-real-time-inference-with-`TensorRT`/), which targets `GPU`, heavily optimizes the computation graph, making `T5` inference very fast (they report X10 speedup on `small-T5`). The trick is that it doesn't use any cache (see below for more details), so it's very fast on short sequence and small models, as it avoids many memory bounded operations by redoing full computation again and again... but as several users have already found ([1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/issues/1807), [2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/issues/1642), [3](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/issues/1799), [4](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/issues/1845), ...), this approach doesn't scale when the computation intensity increases, i.e., when base or large models are used instead of a small one, when generation is done on moderately long sequence of few hundred of tokens or if beam search is used instead of a greedy search;\n",
    "* [FastT5](https://github.com/Ki6an/fastT5), which targets `CPU`, exports 2 versions of the decoder, one with cache and one without. You need the `no cache` version to compute the first token and the first `past state` tensors (aka the cached tensors), and for all the other tokens you use the `cache` version of the computation graph. Basically, it makes the memory foot print 2 times bigger as all weights are duplicated. As generative models tend to be huge, they work around the memory issue by using dynamic `int-8` quantization, the final memory foot print of the decoders is now the same as `Hugging Face` in `FP16`... but 1/ dynamic quantization only work on `CPU`, and 2/ according to several reports dynamic quantization degrades significantly generative model output, to a point where it may make them useless ([1](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/2466#issuecomment-572781378), [2](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/2466#issuecomment-982710520), and [here](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/6549#issuecomment-1016948837) you can find a report in the `GPT-2` context from a Microsoft engineer: \"*int8 quantization are not recommended due to accuracy loss*\").\n",
    "* [Onnx Runtime T5 export tool](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/master/onnxruntime/python/tools/transformers/models/t5) targets both `GPU` and `CPU`. It works in a similar way than `FastT5`: `decoder` module is exported 2 times. Like `FastT5`, the memory footprint of the decoder part is doubled (this time there is no `int-8` quantization).\n",
    "* [FasterTransformer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer/blob/main/docs/t5_guide.md#translation-process) targets `GPU` and is a mix of `Pytorch` and CUDA/C++ dedicated code. The performance boost is huge on `T5`, they report a 10X speedup like TensorRT. However, it may significantly decrease the accuracy of the model ([here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer/blob/main/docs/t5_guide.md#translation-process) when sampling is enabled, it reduces BLEU score of translation task by 8 points, the cause may be a bug in the decoding algorithm or an approximation a bit too aggressive) plus the speedup is computed on a [translation task](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer/blob/main/examples/pytorch/decoding/utils/translation/test.en) where sequences are 25 tokens long on average. In our experience, improvement on very short sequences tends to decrease by large margins on longer sequences. It seems to us that their objectives are different from ours.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the existing solutions, you need to choose one or two items of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* double decoder memory footprint;\n",
    "* be slower than `Hugging Face` for moderately long sequence length / beam search;\n",
    "* degrade output quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach to make autoregressive `transformer` based models 2X faster than `Hugging Face` `Pytorch` implementation (the base line) is based on 3 key ingredients:\n",
    "\n",
    "* storing 2 computation graph in a single `Onnx` file: this let us have both cache and no cache support without having any duplicated weights,\n",
    "* `zero copy` to retrieve output from `Onnx Runtime`: we built over our past work to connect in the most efficient way `Pytorch` tensors (used in the decoding part) and `Onnx Runtime`. Our previous work was to avoid host <-> `GPU` tensor copy, but it still required a `GPU` <-> `GPU`. It is now part of the official `Onnx Runtime` documentation (apparently [thanks of our project](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/10651)!). This time we found out a way to directly expose the internal state of `Onnx Runtime` through a `Pytorch` tensor in zero copy way. Combined with cache mechanism, this is responsible for most of the speedup we have obtained.\n",
    "* a generic tool to convert any model (whatever the architecture) to `FP16` without any risk of having out of range values or rounding to zero: `FP16` is still the way to reduce memory footprint of a model. The main issue is that some nodes may output values outside of `FP16` range or round others to zero, resulting in `NaN` output; moreover, very small values may be rounded to zero which is an issue for log and div operations. We have built a tool which detect those nodes so we can keep their precision in `FP32`. It's quite important to reduce memory footprint of these models, not just because they tend to be huge, but also because past states (that we cache) and internal buffers can be even bigger than the weights of the model themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "As demonstrated at the end of this notebook, **we are able to provide a X2 speedup** whatever the batch size, the sequence length or the model size.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For `TensorRT` we have our own implementation of our approach described above which helps to provide similar latency to `Onnx Runtime`. It's in a Python script in the same folder as this notebook. We had to work around a documented limitation. Because of that the code is slightly more complex and we wanted to keep this notebook easy to follow.\n"

    "## Conversion to mixed precision\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why mixed precision?\n",
    "\n",
    "As `T5` can have up to 11 billion parameters, it requires lots of computation, and even more important, it takes lots of space in device memory.\n",
    "We convert the `encoder` to half precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we blindly convert the whole graph to `FP16`, we will have 2 issues:\n",
    "* `overflow`: some nodes, like exponential nodes, will try to output values out of the `FP16` range, at the end you get some `NaN`.\n",
    "* `underflow`: values very close to 0 will be rounded to 0, which may be an issue for some operations like `Div` and `Log` .\n",
    "\n",
    "### The challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed precision is done out of the box by `Pytorch` and follow some strict rules described in https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Those rules are generic and quite conservative. Many nodes will be kept in `FP32` even if their output is always in the `FP16` range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other approaches we have found:\n",
    "* `Onnx Runtime T5` [demo](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/onnxruntime/python/tools/transformers/models/t5/t5_helper.py): provide a list of operations to keep in `FP32` (Pow, ReduceMean, Add, Sqrt, Div, Mul, Softmax, Relu). We have found this approach to need more an more tweaking on larger networks and encoder part (decoder part seems simpler to manage, https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/11119);\n",
    "* `TensorRT T5` [demo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/main/demo/HuggingFace/notebooks): provide the exact pattern of nodes to keep in `FP32`. This approach is much more effective, but imply lots of code to describe the patterns and may not generalize well, basically what works for a `base` model may not work for 11 billion parameters model. And it does not scale to other architectures without adaptations, for a library like `transformer-deploy`, it would lead to unmaintainable technical debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen an architecture agnostic approach: we inject random input sequences and audit the output of each computation graph node; finally, we make a list of all nodes that have output values out of the `FP16` range /close to zero values and perform some cleaning (to avoid unnecessary casting).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen to use random values only for the `input_ids` field as the search space is limited: positive integers lower than the vocabulary size.\n",
    "You can also decide to send real data from a dataset you want to work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To finish, we provide the list of nodes to keep in `FP32` to the conversion function."
