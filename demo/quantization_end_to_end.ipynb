    "## A (very) short intro to INT-8 quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic idea behind model quantization is to replace tensors made of float numbers (usually encoded on 32 bits) by lower precision representation (integers encoded on 8 bits for Nvidia GPUs).\n",
    "Therefore computation is faster and model memory footprint is lower. Making tensor storage smaller makes memory transfer faster... and is also a source of computation acceleration.\n",
    "This technic is very interesting for its trade-off: you reduce inference time significantly, and when dataset is large enough, it costs close to nothing in accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replacing float numbers by integers is done through a mapping.\n",
    "This step is called `calibration`, and its purpose is to compute for each tensor or each channel of a tensor (one of its dimensions) a range of all possible values and then define a scale and a distribution center to map float numbers to 8 bits integers.\n",
    "The process is well described in this [Nvidia presentation](https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2017/presentation/s7310-8-bit-inference-with-tensorrt.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to perform quantization, depending of how and when the `calibration` is performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* dynamically: the mapping is done during the inference, there are some overhead but it's easy to put in place and usually the accuracy is preserved,\n",
    "* statically, after training (`post training quantization` or `PTQ`): this way is efficient, but it may have a significant accuracy cost,\n",
    "* statically, before training (`quantization aware training` or `QAT`): this way is efficient and has a low accuracy cost as the weights will take care of the result\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we will focus on the third option: `QAT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the quantization aware *training*:\n",
    "\n",
    "* in the inside, Pytorch will train with high precision float numbers,\n",
    "* on the outside, Pytorch will simulate that a quantization has already been applied and output results accordingly (for loss computation for instance)\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation process is done through the add of quantization / dequantization nodes, most often called `QDQ`, it's an abbreviation you will see often in quantization world.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check this [high quality blog post](https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Quantization/) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why this notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU quantization is supported out of the box by `Pytorch` and `ONNX Runtime`.\n",
    "**GPU quantization on the other side requires specific tools and process to be applied**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the specific case of `transformer` models, until recently (december 2021), the only way shown by Nvidia is to build manually the graph of our models in `TensorRT`. This is a low level approach, based on GPU capacity knowledge (which operators are supported, etc.). It's certainly out of reach of most NLP practitioners and is very time consuming to update/adapt to new architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, Nvidia added to Hugging Face `transformer` library a new model called `QDQBert` few weeks ago.\n",
    "Basically, it's a vanilla `Bert` architecture which supports INT-8 quantization.\n",
    "It doesn't support any other architecture out of the box, like `Albert`, `Roberta`, or `Electra`.\n",
    "Nvidia also provide a demo dedicated to the SQuaD task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This open the door to extension of the approach to other architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be both simple and cover most use cases, in this notebook we will see:\n",
    "\n",
    "* how to perform GPU quantization on **any** transformer model (not just Bert) using a simple trick, a `transplatation`\n",
    "* how to perform GPU quantization on `QDQRoberta`, a custom model similar to `QDQBert` and supported by `transformer-deploy` library\n",
    "* how to apply quantization to a common task like classification (which is easier to understand than question answering)\n",
    "* measure performance gain (latency)\n"

    "In our case, the source are `Roberta` weights and the target is `Bert` archtecture which is highly optimized on `TensorRT` for GPU quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, not all models are quantization compliant. The optimization engine (`TensorRT`) search for some patterns and will fail to opimize the model if it doesn't find them. It requires the Pytorch code to be written in a certain way and use certain operations. For that reason, it's a good idea to reuse an architecture highly optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will leverage the fact that since `Bert` have been released, very few improvements have been brought to the transformer architecture (at least for encoder only models).\n",
    "Better models appeared, and most of the work has been done to improve the pretraining step (aka the weights).\n",
    "So the idea will be to take the weights from those new models and put them inside `Bert` architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process described below should work for most architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* load `Bert` model\n",
    "* retrieve layer/weight names\n",
    "* load target model (here `Roberta`)\n",
    "* replace weight/layer names with those from `Roberta`\n",
    "* override the architecture name in model configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no 1 to 1 correspondance (it happens), try to keep at least token embeddings and self attention. Of course, it's possible that if a model is very different, the transplant may cost some accuracy. In our experience, if your trainset is big enough it should not happen.\n"

It takes as input an integer tensor and output an integer tensor. It happens that the `cumsum` operator from TensorRT supports float but not integer (https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorrt/blob/master/docs/operators.md). It leads to a crash during the model conversion with a strange error message. Converting the input to float tensor fix the issue. Not complex, but requires some knowledge.\n",
